## TL;DR

* SI units for electrical circuits:
  * time(t): second
  * current(i): [Ampere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere)
  * voltage(v): [Volt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt)
  * resistance(r): [Ohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm)
  * power(p): [Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt)

* [SI prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix)
* **Directionality** matters. Negative sign = opposite direction
  * Minus to plus: voltage gain; plus to minus voltage drop
* [Ohm's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm's_law): V = IR
* [Kirchhoff's circuit laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws)
  * KCL : $Σi_{in} = Σi_{out}$ (on a node)
  * KVL : $ΣV_{drop} = ΣV_{supply}$ (around a loop)
* Power: $P = IV$

### Current

* Flow of *positive* charge versus time: $i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt}$
* 1 Ampere = 1 Columb per second

### Voltage

* Change in energy (in Joules) from moving 1 Columb of charge
* 1 Volt = 1 Joule change per Columb: $V = \frac{Q}{C}$
* Change in electrical potential ($φA - φB$)
* Ground: V = 0 (manually set)
* $V_{ab} = V_{a} - V_{b}$
* Power supplier (source): pointing from minus (-) to plus (+)
* Power receiver (load): pointing from plus (+) to minus (-)

### Dependent sources
Find where the depending parameter is and note the units. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_source)

### Power balance
Rule of thumb: supply = load. Beware **directionality** of both current and voltage across a device.

## Resistive circuits, Nodal and mesh analysis

* Conductance G = 1/R, Unit: Siemens (S)
* Short circuit: V = 0, R = 0
* Open circuit: I = 0, G = 0
* Passive component: R >= 0
* Parallel circuit: same voltage
* Serial circuit: same current

### Nodal analysis

* Use Kirchhoff's current laws (current in = current out)
* Grounding (set V = 0) on one of the node.
* Super-node (Voltage source): direct voltage difference between nodes, reducing the need to find currents

### Loop (mesh) analysis

* Use Kirchhoff's voltage laws (voltage supplied  = voltage consumed)
* Note that currents add up in common sides of the loops.
* Super-mesh (Current source): direct current inference in the loop.

### Series / parallel circuits

* Serial: one common point. $R_s = R_1 + R_2$
* Parallel: two common points. $R_p = \frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$
* Analysis: combining resistors bottom-up.
* [Voltage divider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider): series resistors
* [Current divider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_divider): parallel resistors

### Resistor tolerance

* Last colored ring on the resistor.
* Need to design some room for the components according to the tolerance (min and max values)

### Y-Δ transformation

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-%CE%94_transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-Δ_transform)

* Δ -> Y: denominator = sum of the three; numerator = product of the twos next to the node
* Y -> Δ: denominator = the opposite one; numerator = sum of products of two
* Electric bridge balance: products of the opposite sides are the same
  * central current = 0 => equivalent to open circuit

### Question

What is the difference between node and loop analysis?

## The principle of superposition

* Effects of multiple sources could be added (superposition) individually.
* Remove voltage source = short circuit
* Remove current source = open circuit

## Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits

[Thévenin's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thévenin's_theorem)

* Simplifying circuit in a black box from the principle of superposition
* Find equivalent resistance ($R_{TH}$) after source removal.
* Find equivalent **open circuit voltage** (source) for Thevenin's theorem
* Or, find equivalent **short circuit current** (source) for Norton's theorem

#### For dependent sources

* Pure dependent sources cannot self-start: $V_{TH}$ = 0
* Finding $R_{TH}$ requires a probe source: $R_{TH} = {V_p}/{I_p}$
* I_p : short circuit current with a probe source
* Like one would do in a an circuit experiment

### Maximum power transfer

When $R_{Load} = R_{TH}$, the power is maximum $P = V_{TH}^2 / (4R_{TH}) $

### Norton's theorem

* $R_{TH}$ the same as Thevenin
* $I_{SC}$ : short circuit current instead of open circuit voltage
* $I_{SC} = V_{OC} / R_{TH}$

## Capacitors and Capacitance

* $i = C \frac{dV}{dt}$
* Smooth voltage change
* At t=0 and uncharged: short-circuit
* DC steady-state: open-circuit
* Energy stored: $0.5CV^2$
* Series / Parallel: opposite to resistors

## Inductors and Inductance

* $v = L \frac{di}{dt}$
* Smooth current change
* At t=0 and no mag. flux: open-circuit
* DC steady-state: short-circuit
* Energy stored: $0.5Li^2$
* Series / Parallel: the same as resistors

## AC steady-state analysis

* Periodic signal: $x(t) = x(t + nT)$
* Sinusoidal waveform: $x(t) = Acos(\omega t + \phi)$
  * $\omega = 2\pi f$
  * $f = 1/T$
  * $2\pi$ rad = 360 degrees

### RMS (Root mean square), effective value

* Peak = $\sqrt{2}$ RMS value for sinusoidal current and voltage.

### Phase lead / lag

* Leads by 45 degrees: $x(t) = Acos(\omega t + 45^o)$
* Lags by 45 degrees: $x(t) = Acos(\omega t - 45^o)$
* Pure capacitor + AC circuit: current leads voltage by 90 degrees
* Pure inductor + AC circuit: current lags voltage by 90 degrees

### Complex algebra

* Euler's formula: $e^{j\theta} = cos(\theta) + jsin(\theta)$
* Frequency term ($e^{j\omega t}$) is usually omitted in favor of angle notation.
* Multiplication: angle addition; division: angle subtraction for waveforms of the same freq.

### Impedance

* Generalization to resistance in the complex domain
  * The same way in calculations as that in the case of resistance
  * Admittance: Generalization to conductance (reciprocal of impedance)
* Inductor: $Z_{L} = j\omega L$
* Capacitor: $Z_{C} = 1/(j\omega C)$
* Impedance is *frequency-dependent*. Higher freq: higher impedance from inductors; lower freq: higher impedance from capacitors

### Filter
* Proved from impedance analysis
* Frequency response: transfer function = gain function
* Low pass filter: the RC circuit
* Bode plot: x: input frequency (log scale), y: response (amplitude)

## RC, RL, and RLC circuits

* First, convert it to the equivalent circuit (Thevenin) for further analysis
* Time constants may be different in charging / discharging due to different circuits

### RC transients

* Voltage is continuous, while current is not.
* For uncharged capacitor, initial voltage across the capacitor is zero (i.e. short circuit)
  * when charging, it approaches applied voltage. The steady-state is open circuit.
* Discharging: positive voltage and negative current.
* Time scale $\tau_{C} = RC$
  * Charging transient: $v_{C} = E - i_{C}R$, $i_{C} = \frac{E}{R}e^{-t/\tau_{C}}$
  * Discharging transient: $v_{C} = V_0e^{-t/\tau_{C}}$, $i_{C} = -v_{C}/ R$
  * $t/\tau_{C} > 5$: > 99% completed charging / discharging

### RL transient

* Current is continuous, while voltage is not.
* For uncharged inductor, initial current is zero (open circuit); then approaches terminal current upon charging. The steady-state is short circuit.
* Discharging: positive current and negative voltage (Lentz law).
* Time scale $\tau_{L} = L/R$
  * Charging transient: $v_{L} = Ee^{-t/\tau_{L}}$, $i_{L} = (E - v_{L}) / R$
  * Discharging transient: $v_{L} = -I_0Re^{-t/\tau_{L}}$, $i_{L} = I_0e^{-t/\tau_{L}}$

### RLC transients

* Solving series RLC circuit by KVL: $V_R + V_L + V_C = E$
  * $\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{R}{L}\frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{I}{LC} = 0$, due to E is constant (DC)
  * Let $I = e^{\lambda t}$, $\lambda = \frac{-R}{2L} \plusmn \sqrt{(\frac{R}{2L})^2 - \frac{1}{LC}}$
  * Resonant frequency: $\omega_0^2 = \frac{1}{LC}$
* Solving parallel RLC circuit by KCL: the same resonant frequency: $\omega_0^2 = \frac{1}{LC}$

### Damping

* Overdamping: $(\frac{R}{2L})^2 - \frac{1}{LC} > 0$
* Critical damping: $(\frac{R}{2L})^2 - \frac{1}{LC} = 0$ (decaying faster than overdamping)
* Underdamping: $(\frac{R}{2L})^2 - \frac{1}{LC} < 0$, oscillation (+)

### Quality factor

![Bandwidth](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Bandwidth.svg)

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_factor)

* At resonance: $Z_{C}$ and $Z_{L}$ cancel each other out
* $Q = f_{r} / BW$
  * BW: Bandwidth
  * Series RLC: $Q = \frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$
  * Parallel RLC: $Q = \frac{R}{1}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}$

## Steady state power analysis

* Note and specify the difference between peak values ($I_{M}$, $V_{M}$) and the effective (RMS) values.
* $ p = \frac{V_M I_M}{2}(cos(\theta_v - \theta_i) + cos(2\omega t + \theta_v + \theta_i))$
  * Twice the frequency: $2\omega t$ compared to current and voltage
  * Average power: $V_M I_M cos(\theta_v - \theta_i)/2 = V_{rms} I_{rms} cos(\theta_v - \theta_i) = P_{app} \cdot pf $
    * Apparent power: $P_{app} = V_M I_M / 2 = V_{rms} I_{rms}$
    * Power factor: $pf = cos(\theta_v - \theta_i)$. The phase difference between voltage and current
    * Purely resistive: $p = V_M I_M / 2 = V_{rms} I_{rms}$. pf = 1
    * Purely capacitive / inductive: $p = pf = 0$. Does not absorb power on  average.
    * For average power, one could calculate the resistive part only.

### Maximum power transfer
When $Z_{L} = Z_{TH}^*$ , Im(ΣZ)= 0,
$P_{L,max} = 0.5 * \frac{\lvert V_{OC} \rvert\ ^2 }{4 R_{TH}}$ (Since $P = 0.5 V_{M}I_{M}$)

### Power factor and complex power
* $p = V_M I_M cos(\theta_v - \theta_i)/2 = P_{app} \cdot pf$. Unit:VA
* Phase difference = 0 (purely resistive), pf = 1
* Phase difference = -90 (purely capacitive) or 90 (purely inductive), pf = 0

#### Active power vs reactive power
$S = P_{app} cos(\theta_v - \theta_i) + jP_{app} * sin(\theta_v - \theta_i)$
* Former: active power (P); latter: reactive power (Q)
* $\lvert S \rvert = \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2} = P_{app} = V_{rms} I_{rms}$
* $P = \lvert S \rvert \cdot pf$
* For capacitive circuit: Q < 0; inductive circuit: Q > 0

### Safety considerations
* 100 mA to the heart: Ventricular tachycardia and could be fatal
* Grounding: increase safety by shunt the current away from the user in case of fault
* Ground fault interrupter(GFI):
  ![GFI](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/FISkizze.svg)
  * No fault: In current = out current, do nothing
  * Fault: If current is not the same as out, it induces current in the sensing coil and breaks the circuit.
* Accidental grounding: new path for currents, new hazard.

## Magnetically coupled circuits

### Mutual inductance
* Open circuit $v_2 = L_{21}\frac{di_1}{dt}$
* Two current sources: self inductance plus mutual inductance
  * $v_1 = L_1\frac{di_1}{dt} + L_{12}\frac{di_2}{dt}$
  * $v_2 = L_{21}\frac{di_1}{dt} + L_{2}\frac{di_2}{dt}$
  * Beware the dot (current direction of the input and output): turn them into statndard circuit
  * The linear model states $L_{21} = L_{12} = M$
* Mutual inductance in series inductors: $L_{eq} = L_1 + L_2 \pm 2M$
* Mutual inductance in parallel inductors: $L_{eq} = \frac{L_1L_2 - M^2}{L_1 + L_2 \mp 2M}$

### Energy analysis
* $w = 0.5L_1I_1^2 + 0.5L_2I_2^2 \pm MI_1I_2$
* $M \le \sqrt{L_1L_2}$, the geometric mean of L1 and L2
* $k = \frac{M}{\sqrt{L_1L_2}}$, coupling coefficient (0 to 1)

### Transformers
* Iron core, air core, composite core
* Ideal transformers: no energy loss (Pin = Pout)
  * $\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2}$
  * $\frac{i_1}{i_2} = \frac{N_2}{N_1}$
  * $\frac{Z_1}{Z_2} = (\frac{N_1}{N_2})^2$

* Analysis of simple transformer circuits (PhD qualification exam)
* Application: AC -> transformer -> rectifier -> filter -> regulator -> DC
* Practical transformers
  * Leakage of magnetic flux
  * Winding resistance: copper loss
  * Core loss: eddy current, *hysteresis*
  * efficiency: $\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}$

## Frequency response
* Resistive circuit: freq-independent $|Z_R|$ = const, θ = 0
* Inductive $|Z_L|\varpropto f$, θ = 90
* Capacitive $|Z_C|\varpropto 1/f$, θ = -90

### Series RLC

$Z_{eq} = R + j\omega L + \frac{1}{j\omega C}$

$|Z_{eq}| = \frac{\sqrt{(\omega RC)^2 + (1-\omega^2LC)^2}}{\omega C}$

* Minimal $|Z_{eq}|$ when $\omega = \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$ (resonant frequency) and $Im(Z_{eq}) = 0$

### Bode plot

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bode_plot)

* x-axis: freq (log(f) )
* y-axis: magnitude (20*log(M), in dB) / phase (in degrees)
* dB is for power amplification / attenuation
* dBm = $10log\frac{p}{1mW}$

### Multistage system

* Amplitude: product of all systems
* dB: sum of all dB gains

### Network transfer function

$$
H(s) = \frac{X_{out}(s)}{Y_{in}(s)}
$$

Thevenin equivalence theorem for finding the gain.

### Bandwidth
Dependent on reactive elements (usually RC circuits, inductors are more difficult to handle)

Cutoff frequency: -3dB (0.707x) voltage magnitude (half power)

#### Quality factor and effective bandwidth

Series RLC: $Q = \frac{\omega_0 L}{R} = \frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}$

Bandwidth (BW) = $\omega_0$ / Q = $\omega_{hi} - \omega_{lo}$

$\omega_{hi} \omega_{lo} = \omega_0^2$

### Poles and Zeros
Let $s = j\omega$ (Laplace transform)

For series RLC:
$Z_{eq} = R + sL + \frac{1}{sC} = \frac{s^2LC + sRC + 1}{sC}$

$H(s) = K_0 \frac{(s-z_1)(s-z_2)...}{(s-p_1)(s-p_2)...}$

* $K_0$ : DC term
* zeros: H(s) = 0
* poles: H(s) diverges

### Filters
* Low-pass <-> high pass by an RC circuit
* Band-pass <-> band reject (notch filter) by an RLC circuit or a combination of a low-pass and a high-pass filter

## OP-Amp

[OP-Amp on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier)

### Ideal OP-Amp

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40054455/96848647-3fe45080-1487-11eb-941b-aaec3988ed20.png)

- Infinite [open-loop gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_gain) G = $v_{out} / v_{in}$
- Infinite [input impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_impedance) $R_{in}$, thus zero input current

* $i_{-+} \approx 0$
* Make sure $V_{out}$ is in the range of supplied voltages.

The rest is Ohm's law and circuit analysis.

## Semiconductors

### Materials

* Group IV: Si, Ge
* Group III + V: GaN, GaAs(P)

### Why semi-conductivity

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Band_gap_comparison.svg/2000px-Band_gap_comparison.svg.png)

* Band gap energydifference $E_{g}$ = $E_{c}$ - $E_{v}$
  * Insulators: > 5 eV
  * Semiconductors: smaller gap, a small amount of electrons escape from valence band to the conduction band
  * Conductors (metal, graphite): overlap (no gap)
* Direct (III+V) vs indirect (IV) band gaps
  * Direct: could emit photons (LED, photo detector)
  * Indirect: emit a phonon in the crystal
* The tetrahedral covalent bond crystalline structure for extrinsic (doped) semiconductors

### Carriers

* Electrons (e-) in the conduction band as weel as the vacancies in the valence band (holes, h+)
* For intrinsic semiconductors, [motility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_mobility) factor $\mu$: GaN (GaAs) >Ge > Si, parallel with conductivity
* Enriched by doping (increase both $\mu$ and conductivity): making [extrinsic semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrinsic_semiconductor)
  * Doping group V elements (*donor* impurities): electrons are major carriers (**N-type**)
  * Doping group III elements (*acceptor* impurities): holes are major carriers (**P-type**)
  * **N-type** semiconductors have higher $\mu$ than **P-type** since electrons have lower effective mass than holes. Thus, N-type is better for high-freq applications. But P-type has dual role, being both resistors and semiconductor switches.

## P-N junctions and diodes

[P-N junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P–n_junction)

### Depletion zone

* Diffusion of major carriers generate an electric field across the boundary
* A zone with little carriers,  high resistance
* Process a barrier voltage

### Applying voltage

* Forward bias: shrinking depletion zone, high conductivity
* Reverse bias: widening depletion zone, very low conductivity (essentially open circuit until breakdown)

### Shockley equation

$I_{D} = I_{S} (exp(V/V_{T}) - 1)$,

where $V_{T} = \frac{kT}{q} = \frac{RT}{F} = 26mV$ (Thermal voltage)

* Forward bias: shrinking depletion zone
* Reverse bias: widening depletion zone, very low conductivity (essentially open circuit until breakdown)

### Three representations of diodes

Assuming there are internal resistance ($R_D$), threshold voltage ($V_D$).
* For $V \le V_D$, open circuit.
* For $V \geq V_D$, equivalent to a reverse voltage source of $V_D$.

1. Ideal diodes: $R_D = 0$, $V_D = 0$. Foward bias: short circuit. Reverse bias: open circuit.
2. With barrier voltage (Si = 0.6~0.7 V; Ge = 0.2~0.3V): $R_D = 0$, $V_D \neq 0$.
3. Practical diodes: $R_D \neq 0$, $V_D \neq 0$

## Diode circuits

Transform diodes into equivalent components.

### Rectifiers

Only half wave rectification was covered.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Halfwave.rectifier.en.svg/600px-Halfwave.rectifier.en.svg.png)


### Limiters (cutters)


### Filters

When the load resistance is infinite (open circuit): peak detector


When the load resistance is finite:
The more discharging time scale ($\tau = RC$), the less ripple voltage. ($V_r \approx \frac{V_p}{fCR}$ when $V_r \ll V_p$)

### Voltage regulator using Zener diodes

[Zener diode on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode)

* First unplug the Zener diode and solve the voltage across it.
* Normally operates in **reverse** bias. ($V_{Z}$ = 4-6 V)
  * When applied voltage > $V_{Z}$: Acts as a voltage source of $V_{Z}$. Open circuit otherwise.
* When in forward bias: similar to regular diodes ($V_{Z}$ = 0.7 V)
* When breakdown $V_{Z}$ is independent of loading resistance.

## BJT

[Bipolar junction transistor on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_junction_transistor)

Current control devices.

### Symbol

NPN BJT (more common)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/BJT_NPN_symbol_(case).svg)


PNP BJT (less common nowadays)

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/BJT_NPN_symbol_(case).svg)


![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/NPN_BJT_Basic_Operation_(Active)_jP.svg)

* B: Base
* C: Collector
* E: Emitter

### Math

![](https://www.electronicsclub.info/images/npnmodel.gif)

- $I_C = \beta I_B$, $\beta \gg 1$ (typically 80-180)
- $I_E = I_C + I_B = (1 + \beta) I_B$
- BArrier voltage: $V_{BE} \approx 0.7$ Volt for Si BJT. 1.1 V for GaN BJT.
- $I_{Csat} \approx \frac{V_{CC}-0.2}{R_C + R_E}$
- $\beta I_B = I_C \leq I_{Csat}$

The rest is regular circuit analysis (KCL, KVL).

One could use the fact that $I_B$ is very small ($\mu A$) compared to other currents ($mA$).

## MOSFET

[MOSFET on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET)

Voltage control devices.

* Gate voltage $V_{GS}$ is greatethan threshold ($V_t$): low resistance, (ideally) short circuit.
* Otherwise, high resistance, (ideally) open circuit.
