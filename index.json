My impressions so far was that, Julia is a functional interface-first programming language, by the power of multiple dispatch paradigm, to make Julia a much more flexible (in programming) and composable between packages: e.g. DiffEq + Flux + GPU kernel), and mathematically natural. However, it requires a vastly different mindset for users coming from the object-oriented worlds like Python / Java. Abstract types cannot have fields. They are only meant to be inherited with their functional interfaces. Concrete types (structs with fields), on the other hand, cannot not be inherited. Use parameteric type (structs) and methods rather than directly type-annotate the fields / arguments. Traits are functions that return True/False/Error based on the input type.
