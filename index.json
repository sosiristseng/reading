This study also distinguished two different classes of fusion, one that allows complete mixing of matrix components and another that allows only partial mixing (transient fusion). The inhibition of fusion or fission leads to a deterioration of overall mitochondrial health in many organisms. Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial motility plays a key role in each of the steps associated with mitochondrial quality control, including fusion, fission, biogenesis, and lysosomal function. A previous computational study (Twig et al.) of the effects of fusion, fission, and autophagy on mitochondrial health in the presence of ROS-mediated damage demonstrated that selective fusion and autophagy can result in stable average health of the mitochondrial population. Here, we present a computational model that incorporates the spatial dynamics of mitochondrial networks into the quality control cycle of the mitochondrial population. As long as the density of mitochondria is high enough to preserve a critical level of fusion, quality control is sufficient to maintain a healthy mitochondrial population.

The fusion frequency is a relevant metric: Average health is only weakly dependent on density as long as a minimal level of fusion is maintained. Imposing a motion dependence on the fusion rate mainly rescaled the effective fusion rate and thereby adjusted health. The cell can enhance fusion rates by actively regulating mitochondrial density and motility rather tha rely on making excessive fusion proteins. Limiting the maximal rate of autophagy to below the damage rate resulted in a sharp decrease in health, while limiting the replication rate caused a decline in population numbers without affecting health.

High cytosolic Ca induces mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas fragmentation blocks the propagation of toxic intracellular Ca2+ signals and can limit the local Ca2+ uptake capacity of mitochondria due to their smaller sizes.

We have ignored the occurrence of de novo mutations.

At rest, $\\ce{[Ca^2+]}_m$ and $\\ce{[Ca^2+]}_c$ are similar, in the 100 nM range. In non-excitable cells, these oscillations are due to a cyclical exchange of Ca between the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), through the biphasic regulation of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) by cytosolic Ca. Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) drives cytosolic Ca to the mitochondrial matrix via the Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU). Extrusion of Ca2+ out of mitochondria occurs through both a Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) and a H+-Ca2+ exchanger. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and two rate-limiting enzymes in the TCA cycle, isocitrate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, are up-regulated by mitochondrial Ca. Cytosolic Ca also directly influences mitochondrial metabolism as a component of the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), the aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC), is stimulated by modest increases in cytosolic Ca. Given the complexity and highly non-linear character of Ca2+ and mitochondrial dynamics ( not the fission/fusion dynamics ), it is useful to resort to computational modelling to clarify their interplay. This model focues on calcium signaling affecting mitochondrial metabolism. We found that a reversible Ca2+ leak between the cytosol and the mitochondria, which could correspond to the low conductance mode of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, was necessary to account for a number of experimental observations. The phase relationship between Ca2+ peaks in the cytosol, the ER, and the mitochondria31 was investigated in details.

My impressions so far was that, Julia is a functional interface-first programming language, by the power of multiple dispatch paradigm, to make Julia a much more flexible (in programming) and composable between packages: e.g. DiffEq + Flux + GPU kernel), and mathematically natural. However, it requires a vastly different mindset for users coming from the object-oriented worlds like Python / Java. Abstract types cannot have fields. They are only meant to be inherited with their functional interfaces. Concrete types (structs with fields), on the other hand, cannot not be inherited. Use parameteric type (structs) and methods rather than directly type-annotate the fields / arguments. Traits are functions that return True/False/Error based on the input type.

Under carbon-starvation conditions (low FBP) and at acetyl-CoA physiological concentrations, PEPC was only activated in ~10% ","date":"2020-10-23","objectID":"/saa-2015-a-general-framework-for-thermodynamically-consistent-parameterization-and-efficient-sampling-of-enzymatic-reactions/:3:4","series":["enzyme kinetics"],"tags":null,"title":"Saa 2015 : A General Framework for Thermodynamically Consistent Parameterization and Efficient Sampling of Enzymatic Reactions","uri":"/saa-2015-a-general-framework-for-thermodynamically-consistent-parameterization-and-efficient-sampling-of-enzymatic-reactions/"},{"categories":["Reading"],"content":"Discussion Parameterization relies on the integration of the generalized MWC model.

Under basal conditions (absence of β-adrenergic stimulation), IKs reduction had almost no effect on human and dog APs, but it severely prolonged the guinea pig AP. In the presence of β-adrenergic stimulation, IKs reduction affected all species to substantial degree. Rate-dependent INaK changes play a major role in APD rate dependence in human and dog. The role of INaK is secondary to [Na+] accumulation at fast rates. For guinea pig, IKs dominates APD rate dependence via its open-state accumulation at fast rate, while in human and dog under β-adrenergic stimulation, accumulation of IKs in available reserve closed states is important for proper AP repolarization and APD shortening at fast rate. EAD formation due to delayed rectifier K+ current block at slow pacing rates is species dependent. did not include mouse or rat APs in this comparison: AP morphology, physiological heart rate, and rate dependence in these smaller mammalian species are set apart due to lack of plateau phase and a different cellular ion-channel profile Human and dog (as well as rabbit) repolarization is due mainly to IKr, which is not rate dependent.

Experiments: SOD concentrations, values reported are ~0.5 μM. ROS reportedly ranged from 0.15 to 11% of the O2 consumption flux The emergence of complex oscillatory behavior within the “edge” region. Oscillations occurred in a restricted region of the parametric space defined by the SODs and ROS production in the respiratory chain. the higher the antioxidant capacity of the periplasm-cytoplasm, the larger the parametric space compatible with functional behavior. As a result when Cu, Zn SOD concentration increases, the ability of the two compartments to tolerate higher mitochondrial ROS production is enhanced, even at low concentrations of MnSOD. The inverse amplitude vs. frequency relationship was demonstrated previously (Aon et al., 2006) and is confirmed by the present, more elaborate, ME-R model. Specifically, the 3D phase space projection of the dynamics of H2O2 released as a function of other energetic variables (ΔΨm, succinate) demonstrates the dynamic-functional interrelationships between processes occurring within the same time scale (seconds).

Hydrogen peroxide is produced by the fully reduced FMN in state 3 The ability of a SQ to reduce oxygen to for superoxide in Complex I is still debated. There must be a high ΔΨ and a highly reduced Q pool (RET condition) in order for an appreciable amount of SQ to form The model best reproduced the data when superoxide from the Fe-S cluster N2 was excluded.

Difference between chemical \u0026 biochemocal thermodynamics is the specification of the pH as an independent variable in biochemical thermodynamics Gibbs energy: G = H-TS T : intensive variable (not changed by number of particles) S : extensive variable (changed by number of particles) @ equilibrium: G is @ minimum specification of pH as an independent variable in biochemical thermodynamics has another advantage: ease of binding polynomial (adenosine triphosphate can be treated as ATP, rather than the species ATP4−,HATP3−, and H2ATP2−) The apparent equilibrium constant K′ are also represented by mathematical functions of T, pH, and ionic strength The assumption is that the pH is held constant during the reaction, The apparent equilibrium constant for the catalyzed reaction and the equilibrium composition do not depend in any way on the properties of the enzyme. In biochemical thermodynamics it is more convenient to take the apparent equilibrium constant and transformed thermodynamic properties of reactants like ATP to be functions of ionic strength in addition to temperature and pH. The Haldane relations connect chemical and biochemical thermodynamics at equilibrium.
