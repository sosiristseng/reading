# Diff and patch


Record (`diff`) and apply (`patch`) changes to the source code.

## Find the difference of two files

For example, I want to apply some changes to the default [`MAKEPKG`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg) in `/etc/makepkg.conf` for my AUR builds in my future machines.

I copied `/etc/makepkg.conf` (the system) over to `~/.makepkg.conf` (the local version) and made some modification.

The the difference of these two files was made into a patch file.

```bash
diff -Nur /etc/makepkg.conf ~/.makepkg.conf > makepkg.patch
```

## Apply the patch file

On the new machine, copy `/etc/makepkg.conf` (the system) over to `~/.makepkg.conf` and apply the patch.

```bash
patch -u ~/.makepkg.conf -i makepkg.patch
```

## Comparing files in two directories

```bash
diff -Nur working/ modified/ > mod.patch
```

## Apply the change to other's working code

```bash
patch -ruN -d working < mod.patch
```

You could use `--dry-run` option first to see if it works.
