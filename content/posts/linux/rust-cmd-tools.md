## bat : alternative to cat

[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.

## exa : alternative to ls

[exa](https://the.exa.website) is an improved file lister with more features and better defaults. It uses colours to distinguish file types and metadata. It knows about symlinks, extended attributes, and Git. And it’s small, fast, and just one single binary.

## fd : alternative to find

[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to `find`.

## ripgrep : alternative to grep

[ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.
