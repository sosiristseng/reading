## Introduction

* Pathological changes of intracellular free and bound Mg2+, ATP, and ADP concentrations occur during ischemia, and reperfusion and the concentrations of these metabolites have been shown to affect the availability and activity of ATP-sensitive K+ and L-type Ca2+ channels and consequently cell excitability and contractility
*  the goals of this study were
    1. to formulate a new model for cardiac KATP current regulation by intracellular free ATP and MgADP that takes into account the octameric channel stoichiometry
    2. to formulate a new reduced-order model of the L-type Ca2+ channel
* The new model reproduces experimental data on the ATP dependence of KATP channel activity in the presence of normal ADP and Mg2+ and the effects of stimulated KATP current on cell excitability and contractility

* whole-cell ionic-metabolic model is described in Michailova (2001), extenden from 1999 Winslow model
* the role of ATP and ADP as Ca2+ and Mg2+ buffers
* in our current whole-cell model the NKA current is not MgATP dependent

## Modeling KATP channel availability

*  there are four Kir6.2 sites that bind ATP independently with equal affinity, but that binding of only one molecule of ATP is sufficient to close the channel
*  channel activation by ADP requires the presence of Mg2+ (MgADP). simultaneous binding of two MgADP molecules to one SUR2A subunit is required to increase the channel open probability

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{KATP} &= g_{KATP} (V-E_K)  \cr
g_{KATP} &= G_{KATP}f_{KATP}([K^+]_o / 5.4)^0.24  \cr
f_{ATP} &= M(K_{ATP}, [ATP]_i)^4  \cr
f_{MgADP}^\prime &= M([MgADP], K_{MgADP})^2  \cr
c_{MgADP} &= 1 - f_{MgADP}^\prime  \cr
f_{MgADP} &= 1 - c_{MgADP}^4  \cr
f_{KATP} &= P_0f_{ATP}(1 - f_{MgADP}) + P_df_{ATP}f_{MgADP}
\end{aligned}
$$

## MgATP regulation in a reduced-order model of the L-type Ca2+ channel
* Here we sought to formulate a simplified model of the L-type Ca2+ channel, which retains the properties of the more detailed equation M34 Markov model yet reduces the complexity
    1. the four channel subunits gate independently of one another
    2. voltage-independent activation gating occurs independently of the voltage-dependent conformational changes in the subunits
    3. voltage-dependent inactivation occurs independently of activation and Ca2+-dependent inactivation
    4. transitions between normal and Ca2+-inactivated modes occur much more slowly than voltage-dependent gating within a mode

* During ischemia
    1. average cytosolic ATP remains in the millimolar range (normoxia ∼ 6.8 mM; 40-s ischemia ∼ 5.4 mM; 10-min ischemia ∼ 4.6 mM
    2. free cytosolic ADP increases from 15 to 30 or 99 μM after 40-s or 10-min ischemia
    3. total Mg2+ dose not change whereas normal Mg2+ increases (normal free Mg2+ ∼ 2mM)
## DISCUSSION
### KATP channel model
* there are four sites that bind ATP but only a single ATP molecule needs to bind to cause channel closure
* simultaneous binding of two MgADP molecules to one of SUR2A subunit is required to increase channel open probability
* there are two populations of sarcolemmal KATP channels open.
* Hopkins model:  one site specifically binds two MgADP molecules and increases channel opening. The other site binds either one molecule ATP or ADP and decreases channel opening
* the gating kinetics of the single KATP channel is not included into our ionic-metabolic model yet
### Cardiac KATP and L-type Ca2+ currents, cytosolic Mg2+, adenine nucleotide phosphates, and EC coupling
* the enhanced KATP current and markedly shortened current and AP-potential durations, were due to decreased free diastolic ATP and increased diastolic MgADP level
* its ability to simulate the modulation of ATP sensitivity of KATP channel by ADP in the presence of Mg2+. When free ADP is > 500 μM, channel inhibition is observed.
* Despite of the fact that Mg2+ is the most abundant divalent cation in the cell, little is known about intracellular Mg2+ homeostasis and mechanisms controlling [Mg2+]i. Assumption: total Mg2+ content is kept constant at the level necessary for enzyme and channel function
* Changes in Mg(0.2–1.8 mM) with total ATP and ADP normal, may have pronounced effect on IKATP. Increase in Mg => shortening of action potential duration (also in experiment)
