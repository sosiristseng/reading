## Introduction

* Mitochondria: ATP generator, signaling, apoptosis
* Related to diseases

## ENERGY METABOLISM

#### TCA cycle

#### Substrate entry into the TCA cycle
1. Pyruvate -> AcCoA
2. FA -> carnitine carrier system
3. Amino acids -> intermediates

### Oxidative phosphorylation

* mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm): –160 to has –180 mV
* The proton gradient (ΔpH): 0.1 and 0.5
* F1F0-ATPase (ATP synthase) H/ATP ratio ≈ 3:1

### Substrate transport
* ATP/ADP translocase (ANT)
* phosphate carrier (PiC): H2PO4- / OH-
* malate–aspartate shuttle, the glutamine carrier, and the tricarboxylate carrier protein

### Ionic and substrate homeostasis
* mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU)
* Calcium is buffered in the matrix by binding to proteins, ATP, and ADP
* mitochondrial sodium–calcium (lithium) exchanger (mNCLX)

## MITOCHONDRIAL SIGNALING

### ROS signaling
* ROS: uperoxide (O2–), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and peroxynitrite (ONOO–)
* The amount of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase is 4 times that found in the cytoplasm of heart.
* H2O2: scavenged by GSH and Trx systems
### Calcium signaling

### ADP signaling

### Apoptosis

## MITOCHONDRIA IN DISEASE

### Ischemic disease
* Ischemia: reduced redox state => reperfusion (high ROS production)
*
### Neurodegenerative disease
* Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
* symptoms are apparent before these proteinopathies are observed (AD)
* In Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and ALS excessive levels of ROS have been observed

## MODELS OF MITOCHONDRIAL ENERGY METABOLISM
* Metabolic oscillations are oscillations in energy metabolism observed during ischemia (not glycolytic oscillations)
    * blocked by antagonists (BZDs) of the mitochondrial inner membrane ion channel (IMAC)
    * Jafri and Kotulska model: phosphate and magnesium
    * Cortassa model: ROS activated (RIRR)
* OXPHOS: push–pull mechanism
    * Magnus and Keizer model: including calcium dynamics
    * Bertram model: simplified version
    * ECME model: plus cardiac myocyte action potential and calcium dynamics
    * Nguyen–Dudycha–Jafri model: mitochondria in neurons
* Enzyme reactions: MM (saturation) kinetics

* The caveat with this is that the **reverse reaction** is not well constrained in experimental settings (initial product = 0). Sotheyare often ommited, not compliant to thermodynamics. Often not an issue since reverse reactions are negligible due to large free energy changes.

## MODELS OF MITOCHONDRIAL SIGNALING
* Hong model: cisplatin-induced apoptosis with ER-stress, TNF pathway

## CONCLUDING REMARKS
* there are many opportunities for the development and application of such models and their integration with experimental work
