## Introduction
* Significant thermodynamic gap between the standard redox potentials of NADH/NAD+ (−320 mV) and QH2/Q (+60 mV)
* Mitochondrial and bacterial complex I also catalyzes NADH oxidation by oxygen, yeilding superoxide or H2O2

## Intramolecular electron transfer
* NADH → FMN → N3(N1a) → N1b → N4 → N5 → N6a → N6b → N2 → Q
* Time scale: μs
* Rate-limiting step: NAD dissociation / CoQ reduction

## Steady-state activity
* the concentration of ubiquinone in the lipid phase is as high as about **10 mM**
* Turnover number of complex I as high as **500 1/s** (pH 7.4, 25 °C)
* **Linear**, not hyperbolic, dependence of the NADH oxidase rate on **molar fraction** of oxidized ubiquinone (Qox/(Qox + Qred)) => Qred competes with Qox for binding at the reactive site with similar affinity.
* respiratory control phenomenon (slow NADH oxidation in state 4, CoQ are reduced)

## Artificial electron acceptors
* Ferricyanide & hexaammineruthenium(III) (HAR)
* Ferricyanide: bell-shaped dependence  => ping-pong mechanism => caution!
* HAR: ternary complex mechanism, no inhibition from high NADH => convenient!
* Bump the turnover rate to 2500 1/s => the half time of NAD+ release should be less than 0.3 msec
* ATP acts as a **competitive (with NADH) activator**, thus decreasing the apparent Km for NADH

## Proton pumping activity
* remains a black box. Some subunits are homologs of bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters as proton-conductive channels.
* 4 protons are translocated per molecule of NADH oxidized and ubiquinone reduced (2ē)
* The NADH oxidase activity of bovine heart SMP could be inhibited by rotenone and piericidin
    * Rotenone-inhibited particles catalyze the NADH:Q1 reductase reaction coupled with proton translocation with **the same stoichiometry of 4 H+/2ē**

## Complex I-mediated ROS production
* Measuring contribution of complex I to overall ROS production by intact mitochondria are extremely difficult (other sources, ROS scavenging)
* About 0.2–0.3% of the total oxygen consumption
* Highest: coupled succinate oxidation (reverse electron transport, **RET**)
* The dependences of superoxide production: bell-shaped (ping-pong). Only reduced enzyme–NADH complexes reduce oxygen? two NADH/NAD+-binding sites?
* Generate **both hydrogen peroxide and superoxide** (Beard was right). The partitioning between the products depends on NADH concentration

* The very low KmNADH for superoxide production => perhaps a component immediately reacting with oxygen has a substantially higher redox potential than FMN (e.g. iron-sulfur cluster N2)
    * N2 close to the ubiquinone-binding site, 3nm from the membrane plane.
* C1-catalyzed ROS production is inhibited by μmolar **NAD+** concentrations. It is safe to assume that all redox components of the enzyme are **in equilibrium with the NAD+/NADH** couple during the steady-state reaction
* @ -50μM NADH: E_NAD = -350mV, close to E_FMN = -370mV. Н2О2 production fits the **Nernst equation**.
* superoxide production does *not* fit the Nernst equation, goes on even when the nucleotide pool is 90% oxidized.

### Ischemic-reperfusion ROS production
* might be relevant to the unusual **hysteretic** kinetics of complex I
    * active (A) state-to-deactivated state (D) when low CoQ; D is equivalent to inhibition by rotenone
    * D- to A-form is a slow process
    * Deactivated enzyme will be directly oxidized by oxygen, not by ubiquinone => increased ROS production
* Oxidizing externally added **succinate** *cannot* be considered as a model of any *physiologically conceivable* situation. No other quantitatively significant cytoplasmic sources of succinate exists in aerobic metabolic pathways.

### NAD+/NADH ratio and ROS production
* Pool (NAD + NADH):  **4–7 mM** in heart mitchondria
* nucleotide-binding sites of complex I are always saturated. But *free* ones are not known.
* NAD+/NADH ratio : **8** in liver mitochondria. **1** in heart mitochondria perfused in 10mM glucose.
* But in vivo complex I-mediated ROS production is many-fold lower than measured under experimentally “optimal” conditions.

### PMF-dependent ROS production ?
* The production of ROS depends on the amount (concentration) of **reactive sites accessible to oxygen**
* PMF only influences redox state of the oxygen reactive sites.

## physiological and pathophysiological significance of complex I and other mitochondrial enzyme-mediated ROS production
* About 15% of intracellular hydrogen peroxide is produced by mitochondria in the rat liver.
* Mitochondria do not produce that much ROS as we think. Local oxygen concentration is low (10μM) due to consumption. (Saturated air oxygen: 200μM)
* All flavo- and iron-sulfur proteins could react wiht oxygen to produce ROS => protection from O2 attack and ROS scavenging are needed.
* Are ROS real signaling molecules? They nonenzymatically oxidize the target instead of simple binding.
* ROS production **linearly** depends on O2 concentration in RET.
* Function of ROS?  unfavorable leakage reaction vs normal metabolic intermediates
    * reductive stress can be induced by the antioxidants: abnormal anabolic activity (FA synthesis), malignancy, activation of ROS generation
